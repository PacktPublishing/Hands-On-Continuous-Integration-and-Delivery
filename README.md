**Build and release quality software at scale with Jenkins, Travis CI, and CircleCI**

## What is this book about?
Continuous Integration (CI) is an essential part of any modern development process. Gone are the days of monolithic releases with massive changes, today it's about releasing fast and often. This book will build upon the concepts of CI/CD and help you write robust automation scripts that can scale and build CI environments for different purposes.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Install Jenkins on multiple operating systems
* Work with Jenkins freestyle scripts, pipeline syntax, and methodology
* Explore Travis CI build life cycle events and multiple build languages
* Master the Travis CI CLI (command-line interface) and automate tasks with the CLI
* Use CircleCI CLI jobs and work with pipelines
* Automate tasks using CircleCI CLI and learn to debug and troubleshoot
* Learn open source tooling such as Git and GitHub
* Install Docker and learn concepts in shell scripting
